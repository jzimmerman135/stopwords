Materials for topic modeling using JGI-linked publications

There are two files:

* all_soybean_citations.csv - raw data file with citations of JGI's soybean genome.
* pub_cluster_template.ipynb - template notebook with some very basic code and a whole lot of jabbering about potential areas for exploration and experimentation.
